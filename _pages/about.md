Hi there! I'm an oceanographer who specializes in computer models of coastal ocean circulation. My research includes inland waterways (such as estuaries, inlets, and coastal seas) and extends from the surf zone to the edge of the continental shelf. I love studying the coast because it's the part of the ocean that we humans interact with most! As a physical oceanographer, I'm trained to study the physical forces that drive coastal currents. Along my path through science, I've gotten to collaborate on many research projects on the interaction between physics and biology. These days, integrating biology into hydrodynamic models is one of my areas of expertise. My weapons of choice are ROMS (for modeling) and python (for analysis).

 Outside of research, I like hiking, cooking, crossword puzzles, plants, karaoke, bowling, dungeons and dragons, camping, movies (excellent or terrible, but not mediocre), birding, my family, and road trips.
