Hi there! I'm an oceanographer who specializes in computer models of coastal ocean circulation. My research includes inland waterways (such as estuaries, inlets, and coastal seas) and extends from the surf zone to the continental slope. I love coastal oceanography because the caost is the part of the ocean that people interact with most! I'm trained as a physical oceanographer to study the physical forces that drive coastal currents. Along my path through science, I've collaborated on many research projects on the interaction between physics and biology (macro and micro). These days, integrating biology into hydrodynamic models is one of my areas of expertise. My weapons of choice are Regional Ocean Modeling System (for modeling) and python (for analysis).

 Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, cooking, crossword puzzles, plants, karaoke, bowling, dungeons and dragons, movies, and birding.
