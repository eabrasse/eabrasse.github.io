I had the opportunity to TA for three very different courses covering a range of teaching situations during my graduate studies at the University of Washington. 

<strong>OCEAN 200: Introduction to Oceanography</strong><br>
Ocean 200 was a lecture hall class designed for undergraduates who were not necessarily oceanography majors. Over one hundred students were enrolled. The course covered ocean chemistry, biology, physics, and geology. I taught a biweekly quiz section and helped design coursework. I was lucky to be a TA for Professor Mikelle Nuwer who demonstrated evidence-based techniques for keeping a large class engaged, especially utilizing the PollEverywhere tool.
    
<strong>OCEAN 320: Coastal Oceanography</strong><br>
Ocean 320 was an upper-level undergraduate course for oceanography majors that covered coastal physical oceanography and sediment dynamics. Because the class had not been taught by these professors before, I got to be very involved in developing coursework and laboratory assignments. A highlight was being able to use a scale model of Puget Sound to teach concepts of estuarine exchange flow and residence time. I also gave two 'guest' lectures on estuarine dynamics.

<strong>OCEAN 529: Coastal and Estuarine Fluid Dynamics at Friday Harbor Laboratories</strong><br>
Ocean 529 was a unique graduate-level summer course for students across the country who were doing PhD research on coastal and estuarine dynamics. During the five-week class, we lived at the University of Washington's Friday Harbor Laboratories on San Juan Island. I was responsible for the logistics of transporting equipment from Seattle to San Juan Island for the field work component of the class, and I helped plan and execute field work with one of the research teams. This included getting a Washington State Boater Education license and piloting a small boat.
